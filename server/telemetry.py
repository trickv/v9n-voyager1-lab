"""Live-computed Voyager 1 telemetry.

All values are computed from the system clock plus hard-coded anchor constants.
No network, no filesystem, no subprocess. If datetime.now() works, this works.

Constants are approximations. Distance grows linearly at ~3.6 AU/year (actual
heliocentric velocity of Voyager 1). RTG output decays roughly linearly at
~4.8 W/year over short timescales (true decay is exponential per Pu-238
half-life plus load-dependent thermocouple degradation, but linear is fine for
a demo that ticks over minutes or hours).

Anchors are pinned to 2026-04-01 so the numbers match public status pages
around that time. Over a bootcamp-length session the values drift visibly but
remain plausible.
